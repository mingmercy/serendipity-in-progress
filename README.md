Working in Progress on Serendipity Chess
I would like to create a new chess variant for chess beginner.
Make it easier for beginner to win games against more experience chess players.
Anyone Interest to help, please let me know.
I am not a coder.
I already created the rule for this game and playing on a regular chess board with special pieces.
